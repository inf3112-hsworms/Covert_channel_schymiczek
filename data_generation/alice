Imperious Prima flashes forth
Her edict ‘ to begin it’—
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
‘ There will be nonsense in it!’—
Thus grew the tale of Wonderland :
While Tertia interrupts the tale
Thus slowly, one by one,
Not more than once a minute.
Its quaint events were hammered out—
And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
Anon, to sudden silence won,
Beneath the setting sun.
In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
Of wonders wild and new,
Alice ! a childish story take,
In friendly chat with bird or beast—
And with a gentle hand
And half believe it true.
Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined
In Memory’s mystic band,
Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers
And ever, as the story drained
Plucked in a far-off land.
The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
To put the subject by,
“ The rest next time—” “It is next time!”
The happy voices cry.

CHAPTER I.
DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE.
ALICE
was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without
pictures or conversations ?”
So she was considering in her own mind,
(as well as she could, for the hot day made
her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in
that ; nor did Alice think it so very much out
of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
“ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”
(when she thought it over afterwards, it oc-
curred to her that she ought to have wondered
at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural) ; but when the Rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waist-
coat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after
it, never once considering how in the world
she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very
deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell
very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her, and to wonder
what was going to happen next. First, she tried
to look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything :
then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards
and bookshelves : here and there she saw maps
and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down

a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it
was labelled “ ORANGE MARMALADE,” but
to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing some-
body underneath, so managed to put it into
one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
“ Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ’ll all
think me at home ! Why, I wouldn’t say any-
thing about it, even if I fell off the top of
the house !” (Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never
come to an end ? “ I wonder how many miles
I ’ve fallen by this time ?” she said aloud. “ I
must be getting somewhere near the centre of
the earth. Let me see : that would be four
thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see,
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a very good opportunity for showing off
her knowledge, as there was no one to listen toher, still it was good practice to say it over)
“ —yes, that ’s about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
I ’ve got to ?” (Alice had not the slightest
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but
she thought they were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “ I wonder if
I shall fall right through the earth ! How funny
it ’ll seem to come out among the people that
walk with their heads downwards ! The Anti-
pathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there
was no one listening, this time, as it didn ’t
sound at all the right word) “ —but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New
Zealand or Australia ?” (and she tried to curtsey
as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you ’re falling
through the air ! Do you think you could
manage it ?) “ And what an ignorant little girl
she ’ll think me for asking ! No, it ’ll never do
to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to
do, so Alice soon began talking again. “ Dinah ’ll
miss me very much to-night, I should think !”
(Dinah was the cat.) “ I hope they’ll remember
her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear !
I wish you were down here with me ! There
are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you
might catch a bat, and that ’s very like a mouse,
you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder ?”
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and
went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort
of way, “ Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ?”
and sometimes, “ Do bats eat cats ?” for, you
see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it
didn’t much matter which way she put it. She
felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
to dream that she was walking hand in hand
with Dinah, and was saying to her very
earnestly, “ Now, Dinah, tell me the truth : did
you ever eat a bat ?” when suddenly, thump !
thump ! down she came upon a heap of sticks
and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
on to her feet in a moment : she looked up,
but it was all dark overhead ; before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was
still in sight, hurrying down it. There was
not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like
the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as
it turned a corner, “ Oh my ears and whiskers,
how late it ’s getting !” She was close behind
it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit
was no longer to be seen : she found herself in
a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they
were all locked, and when Alice had been all
the way down one side and up the other, trying
every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
table, all made of solid glass ; there was nothing
on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first
idea was that this might belong to one of the

doors of the hall ; but alas ! either the locks
were too large, or the key was too small, but
at any rate it would not open any of them.
However, on the second time round, she came
upon a low
curtain she had
not noticed be-
fore, and be-
hind it was
a little door
about fifteen
inches high :
she tried the
little golden
key in the
lock, and to her great delight it fitted !
Alice opened the door and found that it led
into a small passage, not much larger than a
rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
and wander about among those beds of brightflowers and those cool fountains, but she could
not even get her head though the doorway ;
“ and even if my head would go through,”
thought poor Alice, “ it would be of very little
use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I
could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could,
if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so
many out-of-the-way things had happened lately
that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by
the little door, so she went back to the table,
half hoping she might find another key on it,
or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
people up like telescopes : this time she found
a little bottle on it, (“ which certainly was not
here before,” said Alice,) and tied round the
neck of the bottle was a paper label with the
words “ DRINK ME” beautifully printed on
it in large letters.
It was all very well to say “ Drink me,” but
the wise little Alice was not going to do that

in a hurry: “ no, I ’ll look first,” she said,
“ and see whether
it ’s marked ‘ poison’
or not :” for she had
read several nice
little stories about
children who had
got burnt, and eaten
up by wild beasts,
and other unpleasant
things, all because
they would not re-
member the simple
rules their friends
had taught them, such as, that a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long ; and
that if you cut your finger very deeply with
a knife, it usually bleeds ; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle
marked “ poison,” it is almost certain to dis-
agree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked “ poison,”so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it
very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very
soon finished it off.

“ What a curious feeling !” said Alice, “ I
must be shutting up like a telescope.”
And so it was indeed : she was now only
ten inches high, and her face brightened up
at the thought that she was now the right
size for going through the little door into that
lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a
few minutes to see if she was going to shrink
any further : she felt a little nervous about
this, “ for it might end, you know,” said Alice
to herself, “ in my going out altogether, like a
candle. I wonder what I should be like then ?”
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle looks like after the candle is blown out,

for she could not remember ever having seen
such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more
happened, she decided on going into the garden
at once, but, alas for poor Alice ! when she got
to the door, she found she had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she went back to
the table for it, she found she could not possibly
reach it : she could see it quite plainly through
the glass, and she tried her best to climb up
one of the legs of the table, but it was too
slippery, and when she had tired herself out
with trying, the poor little thing sat down
and cried.
“ Come, there ’s no use in crying like that !”
said Alice to herself, rather sharply, “ I advise
you to leave off this minute !” She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she
very seldom followed it,) and sometimes she
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears
into her eyes, and once she remembered trying
to box her own ears for having cheated herselfin a game of croquet she was playing against
herself, for this curious child was very fond of
pretending to be two people. “ But it ’s no use
now,” thought poor Alice, “ to pretend to be two
people ! Why, there ’s hardly enough of me left
to make one respectable person !”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that
was lying under the table : she opened it, and
found in it a very small cake, on which the
words “ EAT ME” were beautifully marked in
currants. “ Well, I ’ll eat it,” said Alice, “ and if
it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key ;
and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door ; so either way I ’ll get into the
garden, and I don’t care which happens !”
She ate a little
